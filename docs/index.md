# Welcome to Reproschema-py

The `reproschema-py` library provides a Python interface and a command-line tool to work with ReproSchema, a YAML-based framework for creating and managing reproducible research protocols.

This documentation will guide you through the installation process, explain how to use the command-line interface, and provide information for developers who want to contribute to the project.

## Getting Started

If you are new to `reproschema-py`, we recommend starting with the **[Installation](installation.md)** guide, followed by the **[User Guide](user_guide/index.md)** to learn about the available commands.
